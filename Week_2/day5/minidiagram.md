   quest: Choose any game system (e.g., health). Identify its source, stock, and sink in one short paragraph.


   answer :

       Health System:
         In a health system the source is healing items or abilities that add health to the player. The stock is the players current health value that goes up or down during the game. The sink is damage from enemies or hazards that reduce the players health.
